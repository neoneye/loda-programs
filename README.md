# LODA Programs

[LODA](https://loda-lang.org) is an assembly language, a computational model and a tool for mining integer sequences.
You can use it to mine programs that calculate integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](http://oeis.org/) (OEIS®).

This repository contains programs that compute integer sequences from the OEIS. The majority of these programs has been
generated (or "mined") using [loda-cpp](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp) and [loda-rust](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-rust).
You can find an overview of the programs and complete lists at [loda-lang.org/programs](https://loda-lang.org/programs).

For updates on new miner findings, you can check the [latest commits](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-programs/commits/main)
