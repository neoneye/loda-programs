# LODA Programs

[LODA](https://loda-lang.org) is an assembly language, a computational model and a tool for mining integer sequences.
You can use it to mine programs that calculate integer sequences from the [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences®](http://oeis.org/) (OEIS®).

This repository contains programs that compute integer sequences from the OEIS. The majority of these programs has been
generated (or "mined") using [loda-cpp](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-cpp) and [loda-rust](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-rust).

There are currently more than :star: **100,000 programs** :star: available! You can find lists with descriptions and links here:
