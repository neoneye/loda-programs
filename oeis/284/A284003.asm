; Formula: a(n) = A019565(A006068(n))

seq $0,6068 ; a(n) is Gray-coded into n.
seq $0,19565 ; The squarefree numbers ordered lexicographically by their prime factorization (with factors written in decreasing order). a(n) = Product_{k in I} prime(k+1), where I is the set of indices of nonzero binary digits in n = Sum_{k in I} 2^k.
