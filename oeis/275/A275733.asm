seq $0,277012 ; Factorial base representation of n is rewritten as a base-2 number with each nonzero digit k replaced by a run of k 1's (followed by one extra zero if not the rightmost run of 1's) and with each 0 kept as 0.
seq $0,5940 ; The Doudna sequence: write n-1 in binary; power of prime(k) in a(n) is # of 1's that are followed by k-1 0's.
sub $0,1
seq $0,7947 ; Largest squarefree number dividing n: the squarefree kernel of n, rad(n), radical of n.
