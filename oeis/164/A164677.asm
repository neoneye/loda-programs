; A164677: For a binary reflected Gray code, the (Hamming/Euclidean) distance between 2 subsequent points x and y is 1, say in coordinate k. If y has a 1 in coordinate k and x has a 0, than (x,y) is indicated by k, if it is the other way around, (x,y) is indicated by -k. The sequence has a fractal character such that G(d+1) = G(d) d+1 R(G(d)) where R(G(d)) alters d --> -d and leaves all other numbers invariant.
