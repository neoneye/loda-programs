seq $0,14486 ; List of totally balanced sequences of 2n binary digits written in base 10. Binary expansion of each term contains n 0's and n 1's and reading from left to right (the most significant to the least significant bit), the number of 0's never exceeds the number of 1's.
seq $0,145812 ; Odd positive integers a(n) such that for every odd integer m > 1 there exists a unique representation of m as a sum of the form a(l) + 2a(s).
div $0,2
