lpb $0
  seq $0,57520 ; a(n) = A014486(n)/2. In binary expansion there is one more 1 than 0 and reading from the left (the most significant bit) to right, the number of 0's never exceed the number of 1's.
  seq $0,30101 ; a(n) is the number produced when n is converted to binary digits, the binary digits are reversed and then converted back into a decimal number.
