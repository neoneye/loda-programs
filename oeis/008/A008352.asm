; Formula: a(n) = A261300(A111061(n))

seq $0,111061 ; Begin with 1,2 In binary 1, 10. To get the sequence, left pad binary number with its precedent: 1,10, 110, 10110, 11010110, 1011011010110, etc. Note the number of bits of the n-th term is the (n-1)st Fibonacci number. Now convert back to decimal 1,2,6,22,214,5846, ...
seq $0,261300 ; Concatenate successive run lengths of 0's in the binary expansion of n, each increased by 1.
