; Formula: a(n) = 1/A319627(A122111(A217434(A057335(n)-1)-1)-1)

seq $0,57335 ; a(0) = 1, and for n > 0, a(n) = A000040(A000120(n)) * a(floor(n/2)); essentially sequence A055932 generated using A000120, hence sorted by number of factors.
sub $0,1
seq $0,217434 ; n divided by the product of all its prime divisors smaller than the largest prime divisor.
sub $0,1
seq $0,122111 ; Self-inverse permutation of the positive integers induced by partition enumeration in A112798 and partition conjugation.
sub $0,1
seq $0,319627 ; Primorial deflation of n (denominator): Let f be the completely multiplicative function over the positive rational numbers defined by f(p) = A034386(p) for any prime number p; f constitutes a permutation of the positive rational numbers; let g be the inverse of f; for any n > 0, a(n) is the denominator of g(n).
