seq $0,3188 ; Decimal equivalent of Gray code for n.
seq $0,19565 ; The squarefree numbers ordered lexicographically by their prime factorization (with factors written in decreasing order). a(n) = Product_{k in I} prime(k+1), where I is the set of indices of nonzero binary digits in n = Sum_{k in I} 2^k.
