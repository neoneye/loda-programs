; A060550: a(n) is the number of distinct patterns (modulo geometric D_3-operations) with no other than strict 120-degree rotational symmetry which can be formed by an equilateral triangular arrangement of closely packed black and white cells satisfying the local matching rule of Pascal's triangle modulo 2, where n is the number of cells in each edge of the arrangement.
