; Formula: a(n) = A057335(A048679(n))

seq $0,48679 ; Compressed fibbinary numbers (A003714), with rewrite 0->0, 01->1 applied to their binary expansion.
seq $0,57335 ; a(0) = 1, and for n > 0, a(n) = A000040(A000120(n)) * a(floor(n/2)); essentially sequence A055932 generated using A000120, hence sorted by number of factors.
