seq $0,61579 ; Reverse one number (0), then two numbers (2,1), then three (5,4,3), then four (9,8,7,6), etc.
seq $0,68106 ; Euler's difference table: triangle read by rows, formed by starting with factorial numbers (A000142) and repeatedly taking differences. T(n,n) = n!, T(n,k) = T(n,k+1) - T(n-1,k).
