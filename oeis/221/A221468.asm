seq $0,125711 ; In the "3x+1" problem, let 1 denote a halving step and 0 denote an x->3x+1 step. Then a(n) is obtained by writing the sequence of steps needed to reach 1 from 2n and reading it as a decimal number.
seq $0,345401 ; a(n) is the unique odd number h such that BCR(h*2^m-1) = 2n (except for BCR(0) = 1) where BCR is bit complement and reverse per A036044.
