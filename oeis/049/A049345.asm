; Formula: a(n) = A001202(A277022(n))

seq $0,277022 ; Primorial base representation of n is rewritten as a base-2 number with each nonzero digit k replaced by a run of k 1's (followed by one extra zero if not the rightmost run of 1's) and with each 0 kept as 0.
seq $0,1202 ; a(1)=0, a(2n) = a(n)+1, a(2n+1) = 10*a(n+1).
