; Formula: a(n) = A048678(A163498(n))

seq $0,163498 ; Those primes p that after each is written in binary, and a 0 is inserted before every 1, then the value of this new number is also prime.
seq $0,48678 ; Binary expansion of nonnegative integers expanded to "Zeckendorffian format" with rewrite rules 0->0, 1->01.
