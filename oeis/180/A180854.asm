; A180854: Square array read by antidiagonals: T(m,n) is the Wiener index of the lollipop graph L(m,n) (m>=1, n>=1). L(m,n) is the graph obtained by joining the complete graph K_m to the path graph P_n by an edge. The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph.
