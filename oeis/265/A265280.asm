; Formula: a(n) = A004086(10*A007088(A110240(n)/2)+1)

seq $0,110240 ; Decimal form of binary integer produced by the ON cells at n-th generation following Wolfram's Rule 30 cellular automaton starting from a single ON-cell represented as 1.
div $0,2
seq $0,7088 ; The binary numbers (or binary words, or binary vectors, or binary expansion of n): numbers written in base 2.
mul $0,10
add $0,1
seq $0,4086 ; Read n backwards (referred to as R(n) in many sequences).
