seq $0,14486 ; List of totally balanced sequences of 2n binary digits written in base 10. Binary expansion of each term contains n 0's and n 1's and reading from left to right (the most significant to the least significant bit), the number of 0's never exceeds the number of 1's.
seq $0,7088 ; The binary numbers (or binary words, or binary vectors, or binary expansion of n): numbers written in base 2.
