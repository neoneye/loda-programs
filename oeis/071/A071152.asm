seq $0,57520 ; a(n) = A014486(n)/2. In binary expansion there is one more 1 than 0 and reading from the left (the most significant bit) to right, the number of 0's never exceed the number of 1's.
seq $0,7088 ; The binary numbers (or binary words, or binary vectors, or binary expansion of n): numbers written in base 2.
mul $0,20
