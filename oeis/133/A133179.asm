seq $0,288807 ; Decimal representation of the diagonal from the corner to the origin of the n-th stage of growth of the two-dimensional cellular automaton defined by "Rule 510", based on the 5-celled von Neumann neighborhood.
seq $0,30101 ; a(n) is the number produced when n is converted to binary digits, the binary digits are reversed and then converted back into a decimal number.
