seq $0,243353 ; Permutation of natural numbers which maps between the partitions as encoded in A227739 (binary based system, zero-based) to A112798 (prime-index based system, one-based).
sub $0,1
seq $0,304660 ; A run-length describing inverse to A181819. The multiplicity of prime(k) in a(n) is the k-th smallest prime index of n, which is A112798(n,k).
