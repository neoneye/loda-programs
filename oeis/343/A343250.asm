; A343250: a(n) is the least k0 <= n such that v_3(n), the 3-adic order of n, can be obtained by the formula: v_3(n) = log_3(n / L_3(k0, n)), where L_3(k0, n) is the lowest common denominator of the elements of the set S_3(k0, n) = {(1/n)*binomial(n, k), with 0 < k <= k0 such that k is not divisible by 3} or 0 if no such k0 exists.
